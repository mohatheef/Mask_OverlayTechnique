Liver Contouring and Masking in Medical Imaging 
This repository contains my exploration of liver contouring for Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC) patients using image processing techniques, built with anonymized data from the Cancer Imaging Archive.

Project Overview:
Objective: To develop a pipeline for contouring liver images and creating masks for medical imaging, aiming to contribute to precision medicine.

Methodology:
Manual Masking: Applied binary masking on CT scans of HCC patients. This process provided hands-on experience in medical image processing.

Image Alignment: Designed a system to align the liver masks with CT images for clearer visualization and improved results.

Technologies Used: OpenCV, NumPy, Matplotlib, Keras.

Personal Reflection:
Although my masking may not be perfect, this project is a crucial part of my journey toward understanding and applying AI in medical imaging. Itâ€™s a learning experience that will help me contribute to the future of precision medicine and healthcare.
